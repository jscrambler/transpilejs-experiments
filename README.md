# TranspileJS Experiments

This repository contains the (partial) dataset used to validate the TranspileJS tool.

It is divided into two main directories:
* `examples`: contains the examples of code used in the valition process and the output of using transpileJS in those examples
    * `custom`: contains custom examples developed to validate the tool 
* `reports`: contains the reports generated while validating the solution
    * `summary.json`: contains a digested report from statistics on the tests executed


Additionally, TranspileJS was also validated against the code in the following repositories:
* [30-seconds-of-code](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code)
